# Pavel Gofman
Welcome! I can describe myself as a person deeply immersed in IT. I am the person who used MS-DOS on IBM PC 286. I do not want to emphasize my age in this statement, I just want to draw attention to the age of my experience. Then I was still a schoolboy. All my life I have been interested in and working with IT. Most of this experience was related to technical support, user support and system administration. A year and a half ago, I decided to switch my field of activity because I realized that I was enjoying mobile development on Swift and iOS. Here you can find my open access projects. Always ready for cooperation, communication and joint new projects!
